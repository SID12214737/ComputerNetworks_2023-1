# This code is a client program that allows a user to send files 
# (image, CSV, JSON) to a server. The client uses sockets
# to establish a connection with the server and send the file data

# Importing Required Moidules
# The socket module is imported from the socket package to create and manage sockets.
from socket import *
# The json module is imported to handle JSON encoding and decoding.
import json
# The threading module is imported to enable concurrent handling of multiple client connections.
import threading
# The time module is imported to measure the latency of file transfers.
import time
# The csv module is imported to handle CSV file operations.
import csv
# The PIL module (Python Imaging Library) is imported to handle image-related operations.
from PIL import Image
